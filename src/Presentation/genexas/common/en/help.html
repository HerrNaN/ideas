<h3 id="exerciseArea">Exercise Area</h3>
<img src="/genexas/common/figures/screenshot-exercise-small.png" title="The Exercise Area of the Exercise Assistant" alt="screenshot">
<p>The Exercise Area in the upper left corner will hold the exercise on
which you are currently working. You can't change its contents.</p>
<p>You will receive a new exercise when you click the <q>New Exercise</q> button that you see
above the Feedback Area.</p>

<h3 id="workArea">Work Area</h3>
<img src="/genexas/common/figures/workarea-small.jpg" title="The Work Area of the Exercise Assistant" alt="screenshot">
<p>Below the Exercise Area, you see the Work Area. This is the area which you use
to rewrite the expression that you are trying to solve.</p>
<p>When you have asked for a new exercise, the expression will not only be visible in the Exercise Area,
but also in the Work Area. The difference is that you can edit the Work Area.</p>
<p>When you think you have rewritten the expression into an equivalent expression toward a solution,
you click the <strong>Submit</strong> button.</p>

<h3 id="buttons">Buttons</h3>
<img src="/genexas/common/figures/screenshot-buttons-small.jpg" title="The Buttons of the Exercise Assistant" alt="screenshot">
<p>Below the work area there are several buttons. Some of them are not always
visible: buttons only appear when they are relevant.</p>
<p>From left to right and from top to bottom you may see: </p>
<ul>
<li><b>Hint</b> Any time, you may ask for a hint. The Exercise Assistent
will propose a rule that is applicable on the current expression in the Work area.
<br>
The name of the rule will appear in the Feedback area.</li>
<li><b>Step</b> When a hint is not enough, you may ask for a step.
The Exercise Assistent will show you not only the name of a rule that is applicable,
but also the resulting expression.<br>
The name of the rule and the resulting expression will appear in the Feedback
area, and the resulting expression will also be available under the Cop button (see below).</li>
<li><b>Derivation</b> One step further is to ask for a derivation. The Exercise assistant
will show you a complete solution, in single steps, with the name of the rule which
is applied in each step, and the intermediate expression.<br>
The derivation will appear in the Feedback area.</li>
<li><b>Submit</b> When you have rewritten the expression in the Work area,
you can hit submit to check the result. The feedback will appear in the Feedback area.
<br>
When the Exercise Assistant detects a mistake, it will try to explain you exactly
where and how the mistake was made. The previous expression will be
available under the Copy button, in case of a mistake.</li>
<li><b>Copy</b> The Copy button is the first button of the second row.<br>
It will be available when it is relevant. It will paste the expression
which is mentioned in the Feedback area to the Work area.</li>
<li><b>Back</b> The Back button allows you to step back in time. The
back button of the browser does not recognize the single steps you
did take during the exercise; the Back button of the Exercise Assistent does.</li>
<li><b>Forward</b> The same applies for the Forward button, which will appear after
you have used the Back button.</li>
<li><b>Ready</b> With the Ready button, you may check whether you have solved the exercise.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="historyarea">History</h3>
<img src="/genexas/common/figures/screenshot-history-small.jpg" title="The History area of the Exercise Assistant" alt="screenshot">
<p>Below the Work area is the <b>History area</b>. 
This area will contain all valid steps of a single exercise</p>

<h3 id="feedbackarea">Feedback</h3>
<img src="/genexas/common/figures/screenshot-feedback-small.jpg" title="The Feedback area of the Exercise Assistant" alt="screenshot">
<p>The green area to the right is the <b>Feedback area</b>. 
All feedback will appear there. </p>
<p>The feedback will appear below the previous feedback. If you feel that the Feedback area
becomes too cluttered, you may clear it with the Clear button above it.

<h3 id="menuarea">Menu</h3>
<img src="/genexas/common/figures/screenshot-menu-small.jpg" title="The Feedback area of the Exercise Assistant" alt="screenshot">
<p>The menu is formed by four buttons just below the title bar.
From left to right you see:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>New Exercise</b> will clear all areas, and show a new exercise in
the Exercise area.</li>
<li><b>Rewriting Rules</b> will show you a list of the rewriting rules.</li>
<li>You used <b>Help</b> to see this text. The Help area will disappear
when you use the <b>Close button</b>.</li>
<li><b>About</b> will tell you some information about the Exercise Assistant.</li>
</ul>
