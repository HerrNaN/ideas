## Feedback services for intelligent tutoring systems

Ideas (Interactive Domain-specific Exercise Assistants) is a joint research project between the 
Open University of the Netherlands and Utrecht University. The project's goal is to use software 
and compiler technology to build state-of-the-art components for intelligent tutoring systems 
(ITS) and learning environments. The ideas software package provides a generic framework for 
constructing the expert knowledge module (also known as a domain reasoner) for an ITS or 
learning environment. Domain knowledge is offered as a set of feedback services that are used 
by external tools such as the digital mathematical environment (DME), MathDox, and the 
Math-Bridge system. We have developed several domain reasoners based on this framework, 
including reasoners for mathematics, linear algebra, logic, learning Haskell (the Ask-Elle 
programming tutor) and evaluating Haskell expressions, and for practicing communication skills 
(the serious game Communicate!).
