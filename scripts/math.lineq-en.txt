# Buggy rules

text buggy.cancel-minus = Cancel terms on both sides, but terms have different signs.
text buggy.distr-times-denom = Incorrct distribution of times over plus: one of the terms is a fraction, and the outer expression is multiplied by the fraction's denominator.
text buggy.distr-times-plus = Incorrect distribution of times over plus: one term is not multiplied.
text buggy.distr-times-plus-forget = Incorrect distribution of times over plus: one term is forgotten.
text buggy.distr-times-plus-sign = Incorrect distribution of times over plus: changing sign of addition.
text buggy.distr-times-too-many = Strange distribution of times over plus: a*(b+c)+d, where 'a' is also multiplied to d.
text buggy.divide-negate = Dividing, but wrong sign.
text buggy.divide-numdenom = Dividing both sides, but swapping numerator/denominator.
text buggy.flip-negate-one-side = Negate terms on one side only.
text buggy.minus-minus = Incorrect rewriting of a-(b-c): forgetting to change sign.
text buggy.multiply-forget-one = Multiply the terms on both sides of the equation, but forget one.
text buggy.multiply-one-side = Multiplication on one side of the equation only
text buggy.negate-all = Negating all terms (on both sides of the equation, but forgetting one term.
text buggy.negate-one-side = Negate terms on one side only.
text buggy.plus = Moving a term from the left-hand side to the right-hand side (or the other way around), but forgetting to change the sign.
text buggy.priority-times = Prioity of operators is changed, possibly by ignoring some parentheses.
