text buggy.abc.minus-4ac = {}
text buggy.abc.minus-b = {}
text buggy.abc.one-solution = {}
text buggy.abc.two-a = {}
text buggy.coverup.even-power = Covering up an even power, but forgetting the negative root
text buggy.coverup.even-power-forget = Trying to cover up an even power, but there is some other operation to be done first. Example: 9*x^2=81, and rewriting this into x=9 or x=-9.
text buggy.coverup.even-power-too-early = Trying to cover up an even power, but there is some other operation to be done first. Example: x^2+1=9
text buggy.coverup.square-minus = A squared term is equal to a negative term on the right-hand side, resulting in an error in the signs
text buggy.coverup.times-mul = Covering-up a multiplication, but instead of dividing the right-hand side, multiplication is used.
text buggy.coverup.times-with-plus = Covering-up a multiplication, with an addition on the other side. Only one of the terms is divided.
text buggy.distr-square = Incorrect removal of parentheses in a squared addition: forgetting the 2ab term
text buggy.distr-square-forget = Incorrect removal of parentheses in a squared addition: squaring only one term
text buggy.division-by-var-both = Divide both sides by variable, without introducing the x=0 alternative.
text buggy.division-by-var-zero = Divide both sides by variable, without introducing the x=0 alternative.
text buggy.square-multiplication = Incorrect square of a term that involves a multiplication.
