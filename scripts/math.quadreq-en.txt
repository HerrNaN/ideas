text buggy.abc.minus-b = {}
text buggy.abc.one-solution = {}
text buggy.abc.two-a = {}
text buggy.cancel-minus = Cancel terms on both sides, but terms have different signs.
text buggy.coverup.even-power = Covering up an even power, but forgetting the negative root
text buggy.coverup.even-power-forget = Trying to cover up an even power, but there is some other operation to be done first. Example: 9*x^2=81, and rewriting this into x=9 or x=-9.
text buggy.coverup.even-power-too-early = Trying to cover up an even power, but there is some other operation to be done first. Example: x^2+1=9
text buggy.coverup.square-minus = A squared term is equal to a negative term on the right-hand side, resulting in an error in the signs
text buggy.coverup.times-mul = Covering-up a multiplication, but instead of dividing the right-hand side, multiplication is used.
text buggy.coverup.times-with-plus = Covering-up a multiplication, with an addition on the other side. Only one of the terms is divided.
text buggy.distr-square = Incorrect removal of parentheses in a squared addition: forgetting the 2ab term
text buggy.distr-square-forget = Incorrect removal of parentheses in a squared addition: squaring only one term
text buggy.distr-times-denom = Incorrct distribution of times over plus: one of the terms is a fraction, and the outer expression is multiplied by the fraction's denominator.
text buggy.distr-times-plus = Incorrect distribution of times over plus: one term is not multiplied.
text buggy.distr-times-plus-forget = Incorrect distribution of times over plus: one term is forgotten.
text buggy.distr-times-plus-sign = Incorrect distribution of times over plus: changing sign of addition.
text buggy.distr-times-too-many = Strange distribution of times over plus: a*(b+c)+d, where 'a' is also multiplied to d.
text buggy.divide-negate = Dividing, but wrong sign.
text buggy.divide-numdenom = Dividing both sides, but swapping numerator/denominator.
text buggy.division-by-var-both = Divide both sides by variable, without introducing the x=0 alternative.
text buggy.division-by-var-zero = Divide both sides by variable, without introducing the x=0 alternative.
text buggy.flip-negate-one-side = Negate terms on one side only.
text buggy.minus-minus = Incorrect rewriting of a-(b-c): forgetting to change sign.
text buggy.multiply-forget-one = Multiply the terms on both sides of the equation, but forget one.
text buggy.multiply-one-side = Multiplication on one side of the equation only
text buggy.negate-all = Negating all terms (on both sides of the equation, but forgetting one term.
text buggy.negate-one-side = Negate terms on one side only.
text buggy.plus = Moving a term from the left-hand side to the right-hand side (or the other way around), but forgetting to change the sign.
text buggy.priority-times = Prioity of operators is changed, possibly by ignoring some parentheses.
text buggy.square-multiplication = Incorrect square of a term that involves a multiplication.
